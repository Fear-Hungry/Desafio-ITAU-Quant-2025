  description: |
    Official OOS evaluation period for PRISM-R portfolio validation.
    Used by all metric consolidation, reporting, and figure generation scripts.

    This period spans from the beginning of 2020 (post-COVID entry) through
    Q3 2025, providing robust walk-forward validation across ~63 monthly windows
    in the current artifact set.

    Period justification:
    - Starts 2020-01-02: Sufficient historical data for covariance estimation
    - Ends 2025-10-09: Final available data for out-of-sample validation
    - Avoids data snooping: Walk-forward with proper temporal validation
